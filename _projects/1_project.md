Over the summer of 2022, I devised a plan to design, program and build a compact 3D printed bipedal robot. My goals for this project were the following: 1. Keep the design simple and easy to build, 2. Minimize the overall weight of the robot 3. Minimize cost, 4. Maximize travel speed/stride length. In the end I believe I acheived these goals. The final product , 1. Takes <6 hours to print and <30 min to assemble, 2. weighs only grams, 3. costs <$30 4. moves at break-neck speed (~1cm/s).

Overall, ArduinoBot was a very fun project and challenged me to apply my knowledge of CAD (specifically SolidWorks), 3D-printing and robot control using C++.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image"
    class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image"
    class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
