Hi, I'm Nick! I'm a final-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Manitoba. I'm working towards a career of bringing intelligence to robots.

After completing an internship at Tesla as an Automation Design Intern this spring, I'm now working in the Intelligent Digital Manufacturing Lab at the UofM as an Undergraduate Researcher. Here, I've developed several software projects including a motion following program for an industrial robot arm using python.

I spend a lot of my free time working on personal projects. Some of the highlights include a <a href="projects/Robot_Hand">semi-soft robot hand</a>, a simple bipedal robot called <a href="projects/ArduinoBot">ArduinoBot</a>, and an object recognition and path planning program for <a href="projects/Battery_Sorting">robotic part sorting</a>. You can explore all these projects and more <a href="projects">HERE!</a>

I always bring hard work, persistence and curiosity to everything I do and try not to take myself too seriously along the way. I put in the time and push way beyond expections. Most importantly, I think robots are really cool.
